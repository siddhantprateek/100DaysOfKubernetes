# What is k9s?
[K9s](https://k9scli.io/) is a **terminal-based tool that visualises the resources within your cluster and the connection between those.** It helps you to access, observe, and manage your resources. "K9s continually watches Kubernetes for changes and offers subsequent commands to interact with your observed resources.


## Getting Started

The configuration for K9s is kept in your home directory under .k9s $HOME/.k9s/config.yml.
