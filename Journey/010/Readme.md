A _Deployment_ provides declarative updates for [Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/) and [ReplicaSets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/).

> **Note:** Do not manage ReplicaSets owned by a Deployment.

A  [Kubernetes](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/containers/what-is-kubernetes)  deployment is a resource object in Kubernetes that provides declarative updates to applications. A deployment allows you to describe an applicationâ€™s life cycle, such as which images to use for the app, the number of pods there should be, and the way in which they should be updated.

A Kubernetes object is a way to tell the Kubernetes system how you want your clusterâ€™s workload to look. After an object has been created, the cluster works to ensure that the object exists, maintaining the desired state of your  [Kubernetes cluster](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/containers/what-is-a-kubernetes-cluster).

```yaml
// create deployment.yaml file


apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: react-application  ðŸ‘ˆ your deployment name
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      run: react-application
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        run: react-application
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: react-application
        image: anaisurlichs/react-article-display:master
        ports:
          - containerPort: 80
        imagePullPolicy: Always

```

More information on Kubernetes deployments

-   A deployment is a Kubernetes object that makes it possible to manage multiple, identical pods
-   Using deployments, it is possible to automate the process of creating, modifying and deleting pods â€” it basically manages the lifecycle of your application
-   Whenever a new object is created, Kubernetes will ensure that this object exist
-   If you try to set-up pods manually, it can lead to human error, using deployments
-   The difference between a **deployment** and a **service** is that a deployment ensures that a set of pods keeps running by creating pods and replacing broken pods with the resource defined in the template. In comparison, a service is used to allow a network to access the running pods.


To create deployment
```shell
$ kubectl create -f deployment.yaml
```

To access the information on the deployement:
```
$ kubectl describe deployment <deployment-name> 
// deployment-name: react-application
```

Create `service.yaml`
```
$ kubectl expose deployment/my-nginx
```



To delete the deployment
```
kubectl delete deployment <deployment-name>
```
